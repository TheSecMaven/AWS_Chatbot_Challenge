# Initial Idea
Develop a bot assistant that understands questions about various characteristics regarding threat intelligence. For example, if a user types in an IP address the bot would pull up all information across countless sources and then show the user anything useful that it found. The user can set preferences based on what they deem most important (Risk Score and Categorization or Risk Score and Geolocation,etc). It could do all other searches than any API can do such as file hash or url search but it checks countless free services and reports back only the things the user deems most useful, whereas most APIs send back clutter and unneccesary things. The bot can monitor for changes on any IPs, URLs, etc and notify you of certain changes that the user deems noteworthy. Would also pull news feeds with releveant information based on keywords. The keyword list can be added to or removed and the user can even further limit or expand the amount of news that is pulled. With the command "news" the bot returns the most relevant news of the day. The bot would be using ML to continuously improve what news it is sending the user by having the user specify if a news article he viewed was not worth his time, and the bot would use ML to further optimize the news it shows that user.
